# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This project was developed to understand the core concepts of logic building and grasp the basics of JavaScript. As I continue to learn and grow, I plan to expand this project with additional features, potentially including a multiplayer mode.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movement of the snake.
2. Guide the snake to eat the food represented by a dot (`â€¢`) on the screen.
3. Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
5. The game speed may increase as the snake grows longer, making it more challenging.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Vite

## Local Development Setup

To set up the project for local development, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lelin07/snake-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

4. Make changes to the JavaScript, HTML, or CSS files as needed.

5. Reload the browser to see the changes in action.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some features and improvements that I plan to add in the future:

- Implementing additional game mechanics to enhance gameplay.
- Adding different levels of difficulty.
- Including sound effects and background music.
- Implementing a multiplayer mode for added excitement.
